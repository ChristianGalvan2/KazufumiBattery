# ðŸ’» Code

## Overview  
This folder holds all of the source code, scripts, firmware, and software logic for the portable powerstation project.  
It is currently under active development, so expect updates and potentially incomplete sections.

## Contents  
- `firmware/` â€” microcontroller and embedded code  
- `control_system/` â€” software modules for power management, monitoring  
- `utilities/` â€” helper scripts and tooling  
- `README.md` â€” this document  


## Usage  
Navigate into the appropriate subfolder to access the code you need. For example:  
- Use `firmware/` if youâ€™re working on the microcontroller.  
- Use `control_system/` when adjusting the software side of the project.  
Ensure you read any comments or `TODO` markers â€” this code is evolving.

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Navigate to `Code/firmware/` (or other relevant part).  
3. Follow the build instructions or comments in the code.  
4. Contribute by fixing bugs, improving modules or adding new features.
