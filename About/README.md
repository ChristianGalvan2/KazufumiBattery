## ðŸ‘‹ About Us  

Weâ€™re **two passionate makers and open-source enthusiasts** on a journey to create practical, community-driven hardware projects that make technology more accessible to everyone.  

Our first project â€” **KazufumiBattery** âš¡ â€” marks the beginning of a growing series of open-source developments aimed at empowering DIY engineers, students, and hobbyists to explore and understand modern energy systems.  
This portable powerstation is just the start â€” we plan to expand into other areas of electronics, automation, and renewable energy as we learn and grow.  

Our goal isnâ€™t just to build devices, but to **learn by doing**, **share what we discover**, and help others do the same.  
We believe that open-source development is one of the most powerful ways to **democratize knowledge**, encourage creativity, and inspire collaboration.  

Through our projects, we hope to build a small but vibrant community of learners, tinkerers, and innovators who believe in the same idea:  
that **technology should be open, understandable, and shared for everyoneâ€™s benefit.**
